    <h2>How is anime different from cartoons?</h2>
        <p>Anime shows typically contain a much deeper message. This becomes apparent in many 
        different ways depending upon the genre of anime you choose. Some shows take the entire 
        series to really get their point across while others instill different smaller values.
        Another thing that makes anime different from a simple cartoon is that many shows have
        much more mature themes and graphic content. Anime doesn't shy away from things that may
        make some viewers slightly uncomfortable. There are many instances where you may witness
        a leg/arm or even a head getting chopped or blown off.</p>
    
    <h2>What shows should you be watching?</h2>
        <p>What shows you should watch really all depends upon what genres you prefer. 
        For the sake of simplicity I'll just tell you about some of my favorite shows from some of the 
        most popular genres. From the the action genre there is a classic anime that always comes to mind 
        for me called "Yu Yu Hakusho". This show has a very straight forward but complex story about
        a boy who dies unexpectedly and becomes a 'spirit detective' who is tasked with fighting a countless
        number of demons. From the mecha (anime robot) genre there's "Code Geass". This is a very complex
        show that really delves deep into the realm of politics in a world that is for the most part taken
        over by a western nation resembling the United States. All of the fights involve giant robots of course!
        "Parasyte" is one of many horror anime that seems to really touch on humanities longing for a sense 
        of normality and routine. This is an underlying theme of a show about a boy who has an alien entity take
        root in his arm. Lastly, "Fruits Basket" is a lighthearted but deep 'slice-of-life' anime about a girl
        who happens upon a group of who can manifest as the physical forms their corresponding chinese zodiac animal.</p>
